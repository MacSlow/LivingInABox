This is a port of Werner Clemens' bounding-box benchmark originating on Windows
with MSVC 2012. He presented that as part of his talk "Living In A Box" he gave
at our local C++-meeting, which is held each month (meeting-homepage, German):

I made a first attempt at porting it over to a CMake-based project compiling
under Linux/Ubuntu (15.10) with g++ 5.2.1 using pthreads and OpenMP.

There's still a segmentation-fault in the VectorDouble4()-related tests. I've
commented them out for the time being.

We want to try to make this codebase work in a more platform-independent manner
to facilitate gathering more benchmarks from different compiler/architecture-
-combinations and compare their performance.
