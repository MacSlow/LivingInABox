Since this is a cmake-based project the usual procedure to compile applies:

 * cd build
 * cmake ..
 * make
 * ./LivingInABox >result.xml

Sofar this has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 15.10) with g++ 5.2.1.
Apart from the usual build-dependencies like g++ and cmake, OpenMP is
required too.

 * cmake 3.2.2-2ubuntu3
 * g++ 5.2.1-3ubuntu1
 * lib64gomp1 5.2.1-22ubuntu2
